# Sorting Algorithm Folder

This folder contains various sorting algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python file for easy understanding and usage.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bucket Sort**: The `bucketSort.py` file contains the implementation of the bucket sort algorithm. Bucket sort is a comparison sort algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets, then sorting each bucket individually.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: The `fibonacci.py` file contains the implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using both dynamic programming and recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. **Hybrid Sort**: The `hybridSort.py` file contains the implementation of a hybrid sort algorithm that combines the quick sort and bucket sort algorithms. This hybrid approach aims to achieve better performance by leveraging the strengths of both algorithms.

4. **Interpolation Search**: The `interpolationSearch.py` file contains the implementation of the interpolation search algorithm. Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a given key value in an array that has been sorted by numerical values.

## Usage

To use any of the sorting algorithms, simply import the corresponding Python file into your project and call the appropriate function with the desired input.

Please note that these implementations are provided for educational purposes and may not be optimized for all scenarios. It is recommended to understand the algorithms and adapt them as needed for your specific use case.
