"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 79, "Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 79, "perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 79, "Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 80, "autocatalytic: the process feeds itself."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 80, "“cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 80, "line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 80, "To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 80, "One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 81, "Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 81, "Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 81, "This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 85, "Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 86, "Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 86, "how a product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 86, "Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 86, "Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 86, "The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 87, "They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 87, "They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 87, "Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 88, "The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 88, "dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 88, "Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 89, "Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 90, "The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 90, "The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 90, "Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 91, "the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 93, "Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing you want to do."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 93, "Chapter Summary"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 94, "His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 95, "Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 95, "As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 96, "As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 96, "Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 96, "Imitating the Close"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 97, "We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 97, "One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 97, "Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 98, "It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 98, "Imitating the Many"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 100, "Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 100, "The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 100, "The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 100, "When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 100, "Imitating the Powerful"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 101, "And that means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 101, "Chapter Summary"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 103, "He systematically reframes each cue associated with smoking and gives it a new meaning."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 104, "At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 105, "Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 105, "Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. Habits are all"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 105, "Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 105, "Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 106, "Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 106, "Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 106, "Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They help explain what we are currently sensing."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 106, "A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 107, "Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 107, "Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 107, "Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 107, "Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 107, "You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 108, "You have to do those things, and you also get to do them."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 108, "Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 109, "These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change the feelings you associate with a particular habit or situation."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 109, "If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 110, "Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 113, "We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 114, "If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 114, "If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 114, "The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 115, "Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 115, "Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 115, "Both common sense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 115, "This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 116, "One group engaged in active practice, the other in passive learning. One in action, the other in motion."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 116, "All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 116, "Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 116, "One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 117, "You need to string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 117, "To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 119, "The changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population that grew slightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 119, "Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort,"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 120, "And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 120, "The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 121, "The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 121, "You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 121, "Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 122, "Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 123, "Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 123, "Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 123, "Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 124, "The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 124, "Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 126, "“How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 127, "In this way, the habits you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are thinking."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 128, "there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 128, "there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 128, "These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 129, "The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 129, "The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 131, "The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 131, "You have to standardize before you can optimize."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 132, "The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 132, "You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 132, "It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 134, "Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the Two-Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 136, "If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 136, "A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 136, "Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking to cut calories,"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 136, "Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 137, "Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 137, "The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 138, "The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 138, "These onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 140, "Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 140, "Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 140, "Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 141, "When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 141, "When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 141, "Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 141, "It is the ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 146, "Everyone said handwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The problem was consistency."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 146, "We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 147, "Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "We are looking for immediate satisfaction."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 148, "You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 149, "Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 149, "the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 150, "With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 150, "Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 150, "As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.*"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 150, "Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 151, "At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "This is why immediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 151, "good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you with something."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 152, "All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that."

"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 153, "important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 153, "Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 153, "Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 153, "And change is easy when it is enjoyable."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 155, "Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 155, "habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 156, "Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 157, "In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 157, "Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 157, "It feels good to watch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 157, "keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the process rather than the result."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 157, "Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 158, "Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 158, "First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 158, "Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 158, "Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 158, "This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 159, "Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 159, "Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 159, "The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 160, "As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 160, "It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 161, "The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 161, "The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose behind it."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 161, "In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 161, "“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place. It can feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the measurement is not the only thing that matters."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "This is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. The"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "This is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress. No matter"
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress."
"Atomic Habits Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results", James Clear, 162, "focus on a different measurement—one that gives you more signals of progress."

"Outliers The Story of Success", Malcolm Gladwell, 186, "The harder you work a rice field, the more it yields. Second, it’s complex work. The rice farmer isn’t simply planting in the spring and harvesting in the fall.

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 7, "How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 8, "a conception mingled with sentiment and pity. Little does he know of the hard fight for existence which raged among the prisoners. This was an unrelenting struggle for daily bread and for life itself, for one’s own sake or for that of a good friend."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 11, "The only exceptions to this were those who had lost the will to live and wanted to “enjoy” their last days.

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 24, "At such a moment it is not the physical pain which hurts the most (and this applies to adults as much as to punished children); it is the mental agony caused by the injustice, the unreasonableness of it all."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 24, "Instead, he playfully picked up a stone and threw it at me. That, to me, seemed the way to attract the attention of a beast, to call a domestic animal back to its job, a creature with which you have so little in common that you do not even punish it."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 27, "Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one’s own life and that of the other fellow."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 28, "Several of my colleagues in camp who were trained in psychoanalysis often spoke of a “regression” in the camp inmate—a retreat to a more primitive form of mental life. His wishes and desires became obvious in his dreams."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 39, "It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 40, "The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 55, "Apart from its role as a defensive mechanism, the prisoners’ apathy was also the result of other factors. Hunger and lack of sleep contributed to it (as they do in normal life, also)"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 55, "The fact that we had neither nicotine nor caffeine also contributed to the state of apathy and irritability."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 55, "The majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be “somebody.” Now we were treated like complete nonentities. (The consciousness of one’s inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things, and cannot be shaken by camp life. But how many free men, let alone prisoners, possess it?)"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 55, "Whenever the degraded majority and the promoted minority came into conflict (and there were plenty of opportunities for this, starting with the distribution of food) the results were explosive."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 57, "For one’s own irritability took on enormous proportions in the face of the other’s apathy and especially in the face of the danger (i.e., the approaching inspection) which was caused by it."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 57, "The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 57, "They may have been few in number, but they offer suffcient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 58, "the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 58, "It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom—which cannot be taken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 58, "An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 58, "namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 59, "If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 59, "The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most diffcult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 59, "Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a diffcult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 59, "Of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is suffcient proof that man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 60, "We have stated that that which was ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner’s inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "men who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp’s degenerating influences."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "what could, or should, have constituted this “inner hold”?"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "A well-known research psychologist has pointed out that life in a concentration camp could be called a “provisional existence.” We can add to this by defining it as a “provisional existence of unknown limit.”"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "With the end of uncertainty there came the uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence would end."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "A man who could not see the end of his “provisional existence” was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 61, "The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 62, "The outside life, that is, as much as he could see of it, appeared to him almost as it might have to a dead man who looked at it from another world."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 62, "In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was to look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 62, "But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 62, "Regarding our “provisional existence” as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose their hold on life; everything in a way became pointless."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 65, "Those who know how close the connection is between the state of mind of a man—his courage and hope, or lack of them—and the state of immunity of his body will understand that the sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "His faith in the future and his will to live had become paralyzed and his body fell victim to illness—and thus the voice of his dream was right after all."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "It was simply that the majority of the prisoners had lived in the naïve hope that they would be home again by Christmas. As the time drew near and there was no encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage and disappointment overcame them. This had a dangerous influence on their powers of resistance and a great number of them died."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "any attempt to restore a man’s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "“He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,”"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "one had to give them a why—an aim—for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging arguments was, “I have nothing to expect from life any more.”"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 66, "We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 64, "Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "“Life” does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life’s tasks are also very real and concrete."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "Sometimes the situation in which a man finds himself may require him to shape his own fate by action. At other times it is more advantageous for him to make use of an opportunity for contemplation and to realize assets in this way."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "They form man’s destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. No man and no destiny can be compared with any other man or any other destiny. No situation repeats itself, and each situation calls for a different response."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 67, "He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "For us, the meaning of life embraced the wider cycles of life and death, of suffering and of dying."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We had realized its hidden opportunities for achievement,"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "(How much suffering there is to get through!)."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "“getting through suffering” as others would talk of “getting through work.” There was plenty of suffering for us to get through. Therefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering, trying to keep moments of weakness and furtive tears to a minimum."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "The individual psychotherapeutic attempts were often a kind of “lifesaving procedure.” These efforts were usually concerned with the prevention of suicides."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 68, "In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 69, "This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 69, "A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 69, "The immediate influence of behavior is always more effective than that of words. But at times a word was effective too, when men- tal receptiveness had been intensified by some outer circumstances."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 70, "But our senior block warden was a wise man. He improvised a little talk about all that was on our minds at that moment. He talked about the many comrades who had died in the last few days, either of sickness or of suicide. But he also mentioned what may have been the real reason for their deaths: giving up hope."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 70, "I said that even in this Europe in the sixth winter of the Second World War, our situation was not the most terrible we could think of."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 70, "Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society —all these were things that could be achieved again or restored."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 70, "And I quoted from Nietzsche: “Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker.” (That which does not kill me, makes me stronger.)"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "But I also told them that, in spite of this, I had no intention of losing hope and giving up. For no man knew what the future would bring, much less the next hour."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "For instance, one might be attached unexpectedly to a special group with exceptionally good working conditions—for this was the kind of thing which constituted the “luck” of the prisoner."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "Again I quoted a poet—to avoid sounding like a preacher myself—who had written, “Was Du erlebst, kann keine Macht der Welt Dir rauben.” (What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you.)"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 71, "Then I spoke of the many opportunities of giving life a meaning. I told my comrades (who lay motionless, although occasionally a sigh could be heard) that human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have a meaning, and that this infinite meaning of life includes suffering and dying, privation and death."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 72, "I said that someone looks down on each of us in diffcult hours—a friend, a wife, somebody alive or dead, or a God—and he would not expect us to disappoint him. He would hope to find us suffering proudly—not miserably—knowing how to die."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 72, "For this man, suffering and death were meaningful; his was a sacrifice of the deepest significance. He did not want to die for nothing. None of us wanted that."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 72, "The purpose of my words was to find a full meaning in our life, then and there, in that hut and in that practically hopeless situation."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 72, "But I have to confess here that only too rarely had I the inner strength to make contact with my companions in suffering and that I must have missed many opportunities for doing so."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "First, among the guards there were some sadists, sadists in the purest clinical sense."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "Second, these sadists were always selected when a really severe detachment of guards was needed."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "When the SS took a dislike to a person, there was always some special man in their ranks known to have a passion for, and to be highly specialized in, sadistic torture, to whom the unfortunate prisoner was sent."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "Third, the feelings of the majority of the guards had been dulled by the number of years in which, in ever-increasing doses, they had witnessed the brutal methods of the camp. These morally and mentally hardened men at least refused to take active part in sadistic measures. But they did not prevent others from carrying them out."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "Fourth, it must be stated that even among the guards there were some who took pity on us."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "But the senior camp warden, a prisoner himself, was harder than any of the SS guards. He beat the other prisoners at every slightest opportunity, while the camp commander, to my knowledge, never once lifted his hand against any of us."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 73, "Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn. The boundaries between groups overlapped and we must not try to simplify matters by saying that these men were angels and those were devils."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 74, "baseness of a prisoner who treated his own companions badly was exceptionally contemptible."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 74, "It was the human “something” which this man also gave to me—the word and look which accompanied the gift."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 74, "From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two—the “race” of the decent man and the “race” of the indecent man."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 74, "The rift dividing good from evil, which goes through all human beings, reaches into the lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by the concentration camp."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 75, "“Freedom”—we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not grasp it. We had said this word so often during all the years we dreamed about it, that it had lost its meaning. Its reality did not penetrate into our consciousness; we could not grasp the fact that freedom was ours."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 75, "Psychologically, what was happening to the liberated prisoners could be called “depersonalization.” Everything appeared unreal, unlikely, as in a dream. We could not believe it was true. How often in the past years had we been deceived by dreams!"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 76, "The pressure which had been on his mind for years was released at last. Hearing him talk, one got the impression that he had to talk, that his desire to speak was irresistible."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 76, "Many days passed, until not only the tongue was loosened, but something within oneself as well; then feeling suddenly broke through the strange fetters which had restrained it."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 77, "so the man who has suddenly been liberated from mental pressure can suffer damage to his moral and spiritual health."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 77, "They became instigators, not objects, of willful force and injustice. They justified their behavior by their own terrible experiences."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 77, "“You don’t say! And hasn’t enough been taken from us? My wife and child have been gassed—not to mention everything else—and you would forbid me to tread on a few stalks of oats!”"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 77, "no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 78, "Apart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden release of mental pressure, there were two other fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the character of the liberated prisoner: bitterness and disillusionment when he returned to his former life."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 78, "Bitterness was caused by a number of things he came up against in his former home town."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 78, "A man who for years had thought he had reached the absolute limit of all possible suffering now found that suffering has no limits, and that he could suffer still more, and still more intensely."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 78, "had to be reminded that life still waited for him, that a human being waited for his return. But after liberation? There were some men who found that no one awaited them."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 79, "We all said to each other in camp that there could be no earthly happiness which could compensate for all we had suffered."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 79, "This disillusionment, which awaited not a small number of prisoners, was an experience which these men have found very hard to get over and which, for a psychiatrist, is also very diffcult to help them overcome."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 81, "focuses on the meaning of human existence as well"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 81, "According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a “secondary rationalization” of instinctual drives."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning."

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!"
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "89 percent of the people polled admitted that man needs “something” for the sake of which to live."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "61 percent conceded that there was something, or someone, in their own lives for whose sake they were even ready to die."
"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 82, "78 percent said their first goal was “finding a purpose and meaning to my life.”"

"Man's Search for Meaning", Viktor Frankl, 83, "“existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to (1) existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3) the striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1042, "priming phenomenon—the influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1050, "if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1114, "The idea you should focus on, however, is that disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1136, "System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1140, "System 1 is also, as we will see in the following chapters, the origin of many of the systematic errors in your intuitions."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1157, "One of the dials measures cognitive ease, and its range is between “Easy” and “Strained.”"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1161, "Cognitive strain is affected by both the current level of effort and the presence of unmet demands."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1186, "“The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of prior experience.”"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1189, "Words that you have seen before become easier to see again—you can identify them better than other words when they are shown very briefly or masked by noise,"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1191, "In short, you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1213, "impression of familiarity is produced by System 1, and System 2 relies on that impression for a true/false judgment."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1216, "A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1222, "If you cannot remember the source of a statement, and have no way to relate it to other things you know, you have no option but to go with the sense of cognitive ease."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1248, "The aphorisms were judged more insightful when they rhymed than when they did not."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1263, "This is the message of figure 5: the sense of ease or strain has multiple causes, and it is difficult to tease them apart."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1300, "As we saw in figure 5, repetition induces cognitive ease and a comforting feeling of familiarity."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1317, "System 1 can respond to impressions of events of which System 2 is unaware. Indeed, the mere exposure effect is actually stronger for stimuli that the individual never consciously sees"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1322, "The mere exposure effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1353, "A sense of cognitive ease is apparently generated by a very faint signal from the associative machine, which “knows” that the three words are coherent (share an association) long before the association is retrieved"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1359, "They found that putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1376, "The impression of cognitive ease that comes with the presentation of a coherent triad appears to be mildly pleasurable in itself."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1385, "Emotional changes are now expected, and because they are unsurprising they are not linked causally to the words."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1414, "Some expectations are active and conscious—you know you are waiting for a particular event to happen."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1416, "But there is a much larger category of events that you expect passively; you don’t wait for them, but you are not surprised when they happen."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1423, "first, this was a more remarkable coincidence than the first meeting; second, we were distinctly less surprised to meet Jon on the second occasion than we had been on the first."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1446, "However, the second abnormal event will retrieve the first from memory, and both make sense together. The two events fit into a pattern, in which the guest is an exceptionally tense person."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1459, "Studies of brain responses have shown that violations of normality are detected with astonishing speed and subtlety."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1468, "these norms provide the background for the immediate detection of anomalies"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1474, "System 1, which understands language, has access to norms of categories, which specify the range of plausible values as well as the most typical cases."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1480, "Finding such causal connections is part of understanding a story and is an automatic operation of System"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1489, "In fact, all the headlines do is satisfy our need for coherence:"
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1489, "a large event is supposed to have consequences, and consequences need causes to explain them."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1490, "System 1 is adept at finding a coherent causal story that links the fragments of knowledge at its disposal."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1499, "In the story of the startling soup, the outcome—whether another customer wincing at the taste of the soup or the first person’s extreme reaction to the waiter’s touch—brings about an associatively coherent interpretation of the initial surprise, completing a plausible story."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1510, "Experiments have shown that six-month-old infants see the sequence of events as a cause-effect scenario, and they indicate surprise when the sequence is altered."

"Thinking, Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman, 1977, "the dominant impression of 3-D size dictates the judgment of 2-D size. The illusion is due to a 3-D heuristic."

"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 89, "express their thoughts and feelings with others who were dealing with a similar experience, which can be a valuable form of normalization."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 90, "When people are upset, they are strongly driven to share their feelings with others; emotions act like jet fuel that propels us to talk to other people about the thoughts and feelings streaming through our heads."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 91, "people need to purge themselves of their emotions after watching a tragic event, a process he called catharsis."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 91, "Strong feelings need to be released like the steam escaping from a boiling kettle."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 92, "the underlying drive to air our inner voice is actually implanted in our minds at an even earlier stage of our development—when we are drooling, screaming babies."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 92, "physiological"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 92, "cause and effect, how to remedy our problems and deal with our emotions. This not only provides us with useful information for managing how we feel; it also provides us with the storytelling tools we need to talk to others about our experiences."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "As a result, the first thing we usually seek out in others when our inner voice gets swamped in negativity is a fulfillment of our emotional needs."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "When we’re upset and feel vulnerable or hurt or overwhelmed, we want to vent our emotions and feel consoled, validated, and understood"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "another stress-response system that many people engage in when under threat: a “tend and befriend” response. They seek out other people for support and care."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "attenuating"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "It triggers a cascade of stress-attenuating biochemical reactions—involving naturally produced opioids as well as oxytocin, the so-called cuddle hormone—and feeds the basic need humans have to belong."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 93, "affiliating with others while under stress provides us with a sense of security and connection. It triggers a cascade of stress-attenuating biochemical reactions—involving naturally produced opioids as well as oxytocin, the so-called cuddle hormone—and feeds the basic need humans have to belong. And of course, a principal way we do this is by talking."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 94, "When our minds are bathed in chatter, we display a strong bias toward satisfying our emotional needs over our cognitive ones."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 94, "we’re dealing with chatter, we confront a riddle that demands solving."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 94, "When we’re dealing with chatter, we confront a riddle that demands solving. Inhibited by our inner voice run amok, we at times need outside help to work through the problem at hand, see the bigger picture, and decide on the most constructive course of action."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 94, "when we’re upset, we tend to overfocus on receiving empathy rather than finding practical solutions."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 94, "The people we seek out for help respond in kind, prioritizing our emotional needs over our cognitive ones. They see our pain and first and foremost strive to provide us with love and validation."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 95, "To demonstrate that they are there to offer emotional support, people are usually motivated to find out exactly what happened to upset us—the who-what-when-where-why of the problem."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 95, "leading us to relive the very feelings and experiences that have driven us to seek out support in the first place, a phenomenon called co-rumination."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 95, "While we feel more connected and supported by those who engage us this way, it doesn’t help us generate a plan or creatively reframe the problem at hand. Instead, it fuels our negative emotions and biological threat response."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 95, "That is because our memories of emotional experiences are governed by principles of associationism, which means that related concepts are linked together in our mind."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 95, "This is because when it comes to our inner voice, the game of dominoes provides a more appropriate metaphor. When we focus on a negative aspect of our experience, that tends to activate a related negative thought, which activates another negative thought, and another, and so on."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 96, "The associative nature of memory, combined with the bias we have to prioritize emotional needs over cognitive ones when we’re upset, is why talking often fails to lift our troubled internal dialogues into a more tranquil state."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 97, "emotion and cognition—between what we feel and what we think"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 97, "Star Trek characters of Captain Kirk and Officer Spock. Kirk is all heart, a man of intense and compelling emotions. He’s fire. By contrast, Spock, that lovable, pointy-eared half human half Vulcan, is all head; he’s a cerebral problem solver unencumbered by the distractions of feelings. He’s ice."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 97, "The most effective verbal exchanges are those that integrate both the social and the cognitive needs of the person seeking support"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 97, "The advantage of such approaches is that you’re able to make people who are upset feel validated and connected, yet you can then pivot to providing them with the kind of big-picture advice that you, as someone who is not immersed in their chatter, are uniquely equipped to provide."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 98, "Along with prioritizing the need for compassionate engagement over the use of force, he stressed patience. Once the hostage takers understood that they weren’t in immediate danger, their autonomic threat response (presumably) eased. This reduced the negative frenzy of their inner voice, allowing the negotiator to shift the dialogue toward ending the standoff."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 98, "one version of this balancing act was codified decades ago by the New York Police Department Hostage Negotiations Team,"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 97, "This is where a certain art in talking to other people comes into play, because you must walk a tightrope to take upset people from addressing their emotional needs to the more practical cognitive ones."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 98, "the FBI. The bureau developed its own approach called the Behavioral Change Stairway Model, a progression of steps to guide negotiators: Active Listening → Empathy → Rapport → Influence → Behavioral Change."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 99, "By thinking through other experiences with your “chatter advisers,” you can also narrow in on which people are right for which problems."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 99, "The most important point here is to think critically after a chatter-provoking event occurs and reflect on who helped you—or didn’t. This is how you build your chatter board of advisers, and in the internet age we can find unprecedented new resources online."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 100, "It Gets Better has rescued the inner voices of so many emotionally vulnerable people because, in essence, it acts as a distancing tool promoting normalization—everybody gets picked on, but we all get through it—and mental time travel."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 100, "Most fascinating of all is the fact that people who watch the video don’t have to actually know the speakers to benefit from their advice,"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 101, "forms of therapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy employ precisely the kinds of techniques we’ve been talking about throughout this chapter; they provide clients with emotional support while also crucially helping them engage in cognitive problem solving."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 101, "psychological debriefing, an approach that emphasizes the value of emotional unburdening in the immediate aftermath of negative experiences despite overwhelming evidence arguing against its benefits."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 101, "After all, observing those we care about in need is a powerful neurobiological experience. It triggers empathy, which motivates us to want to act on their behalf."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "When we give advice at the wrong time, this too can backfire."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "archetypal"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "Personal Note: Typical for people or things"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "self-efficacy—the crucial belief that we are capable of managing challenges."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "Offering advice without considering the person’s needs can undermine a person’s sense of self-efficacy—the crucial belief that we are capable of managing challenges."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "when we are aware that others are helping us but we haven’t invited their assistance, we interpret this to mean that we must be helpless or ineffective in some way—a feeling that our inner voice may latch on to."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 102, "psychological research into self-efficacy has shown that when it is compromised, it damages not only our self-esteem but also our health, decision making, and relationships."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 103, "helping without the recipient being aware of it, a phenomenon called “invisible support,”"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 103, "surreptitious practical support, like taking care of housework without being asked or creating more quiet space for the person to work. Or it can involve skillfully providing people with perspective-broadening advice without their realizing that it is explicitly directed to them."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 103, "For example, asking someone else for input that has implications for your friend or loved one in the presence of the person who needs it (a kind of invisible advice)"
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 103, "normalizing the experience by talking about how other people have dealt with similar experiences."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 103, "these things transmits needed information and support, but without shining a spotlight on the vulnerable person’s seeming shortcomings."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 104, "invisible support is most effective: when people are under evaluation or preparing to be."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 104, "when they’re studying for exams, preparing for interviews, or rehearsing the talking points of a presentation."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 104, "when people want to manage their chatter as quickly and efficiently as possible, it’s not necessary to be subtle or crafty in how you support. In this case, direct advice that blends Kirk and Spock is most needed, appropriate, and likely to succeed."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 104, "subtly aiding people we are very close to who find themselves submerged in chatter, and it’s completely nonverbal: affectionate touch."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 105, "Indeed, many scientists consider the skin a social organ. In this sense, our contact with others is part of an ongoing nonverbal conversation that can benefit our emotions."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 104, "Caring physical contact from people we know and trust lowers our biological threat response, improves our ability to deal with stress, promotes relationship satisfaction, and reduces feelings of loneliness. It also activates the brain’s reward circuitry and triggers the release of stress-relieving neurochemicals such as oxytocin and endorphins."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 106, "The thing we don’t often think about when we seek or give support, online or off-, is that, objectively speaking, the people in our lives form a social environment."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 106, "What we’ve been learning is how to navigate that environment to maximize positive outcomes for the inner voice."
"Chatter The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It", Ethan Kross, 106, "But other people are only one facet of our environment that we can harness to improve our internal conversations."
